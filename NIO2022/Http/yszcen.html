                            <p>Knot is a HTTP sniffer, a source of HTTP traffics will be necessary. Knot used a VPN tunnel to set up a source of HTTP traffics from both Wi-Fi and cellular of local device. All traffics just forwarded to their original destination addresses with local HTTP proxy (not any remote proxy) in Knot. You can view, delete or share the recorded traffic data as you need. Data will not upload anywhere, it’s just stored in app local under your full control.</p>
