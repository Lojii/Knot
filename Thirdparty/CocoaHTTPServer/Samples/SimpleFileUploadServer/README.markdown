INFO:

This example project demonstrates the ability of accepting a file upload.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the Xcode project, and build and go.

On the Xcode console you'll see a message saying:
"Started HTTP server on port 59123"

Now open your browser and type in the URL:
http://localhost:59123

(Replace 59123 with whatever port the server is actually running on.)

Enjoy.
