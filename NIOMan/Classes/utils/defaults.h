 * Default leaf key RSA keysize in bits.
 *
 * While implementations still generally accepted leaf keys of 1024 bits in
 * size, we used 1024 for leaf keys.  As implementations are starting to sunset
 * 1024 bit RSA not only for CA keys, but also for leaf keys, we now use a 2048
 * bit key size for the leaf cert key in order to maximize interoperability in
 * default config.
 *
 * Users who want a different size, for example 1024 bit RSA for performance,
 * can always use their own pre-generated leaf key using the -K option instead
 * of generating one automatically.
 *
 * Refer to the following resources on key sizes accepted by different
 * implementations.  Note that OpenSSL security level restrictions potentially
 * apply to both sslsplit and all of the clients and servers using OpenSSL.
